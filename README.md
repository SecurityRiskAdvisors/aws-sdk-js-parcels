# aws-sdk-js-parcels
A repo for individual AWS SDK components

# WIP

## Instructions
Use this repo as a base for jsdeliver to pull files.

The repo is tagged with the same SDK versions as the official repo and master will always be the latest tag.

All JS files will include the API versions, if you want other JS files, open an issue and it will be added.
